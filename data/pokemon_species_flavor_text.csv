11542,705,28,"This Pokémon’s mucous can dissolve anything.
Toothless, it sprays mucous on its prey. Once
they’re nicely dissolved, it slurps them up."

on its back is filled with its brain and
other organs."

will hug its beloved Trainer, leaving
that Trainer covered in sticky slime."

of the force of a hundred pro boxers."

It throws a punch that’s the equivalent
of the force of a hundred pro boxers."
11548,706,28,"It gets picked on because it’s meek. But then,
whoever teased it gets to feel the full force of
its horns and a good swatting from its thick tail."
11549,706,29,"It’s very friendly toward people. If you grow
close to it, Goodra will hug you with its sticky,
slime-covered body. Don’t get mad."
11550,707,23,"These key collectors threaten any attackers
by fiercely jingling their keys at them."
11551,707,24,"It never lets go of a key that it likes,
so people give it the keys to vaults and
safes as a way to prevent crime."
11552,707,25,"These key collectors threaten any attackers
by fiercely jingling their keys at them."
11553,707,26,"It never lets go of a key that it likes,
so people give it the keys to vaults and
safes as a way to prevent crime."
11554,707,28,"It inserts its horn into chinks in metal, absorbing
metal ions. For some reason, it collects keys."
11555,707,29,"Although it’s unclear why it collects keys, giving
it a key makes Klefki very happy. However, it
apparently only likes master keys."
11556,708,23,"These Pokémon are created when
spirits possess rotten tree stumps.
They prefer to live in abandoned forests."
11557,708,24,"According to old tales, these Pokémon are

children who died while lost in the forest."

can be made by plucking the green leaves on its
head, brewing them, and boiling down the liquid."

people to get hopelessly lost deep in the forest.
It’s trying to make friends with them."

who harm the forest, so they can never leave."

trees. A deadly curse falls upon anyone cutting
down trees in forests where Trevenant dwell."
11567,709,29,"It’s feared as a ghost of the forest.
Lumberjacks bring along Fire types, which
Trevenant hates, when they enter the forest."
11568,710,23,"The pumpkin body is inhabited by a spirit
trapped in this world. As the sun sets,
it becomes restless and active."

to the place where they belong
so they can move on."

it becomes restless and active."

11572,711,23,"Singing in eerie voices, they wander
town streets on the night of the new moon.
Anyone who hears their song is cursed."

It sings joyfully as it observes the
suffering of its prey."

ice that shields its body. It uses cold air

freeze opponents solid. They live in herds
above the snow line on mountains."

11580,713,23,"Its ice-covered body is as hard as steel.
Its cumbersome frame crushes anything that
stands in its way."
11581,713,24,"The way several Bergmite huddle
on its back makes it look like
an aircraft carrier made of ice."
11582,713,25,"Its ice-covered body is as hard as steel.
Its cumbersome frame crushes anything that
stands in its way."
11583,713,26,"The way several Bergmite huddle
on its back makes it look like
an aircraft carrier made of ice."
11584,714,23,"They live in pitch-black caves. Their enormous ears
can emit ultrasonic waves of 200,000 hertz."
11585,714,24,"Even a robust wrestler will become
dizzy and unable to stand when exposed
to its 200,000-hertz ultrasonic waves."
11586,714,25,"They live in pitch-black caves. Their enormous ears
can emit ultrasonic waves of 200,000 hertz."
11587,714,26,"Even a robust wrestler will become
dizzy and unable to stand when exposed
to its 200,000-hertz ultrasonic waves."
11588,714,29,"Fruits are its favorite foods. This gourmet
carefully picks out just the ripe ones using
its sonar."
11589,715,23,"They fly around on moonless nights
and attack careless prey. Nothing can
beat them in a battle in the dark."

beat them in a battle in the dark."
11592,715,26,"The ultrasonic waves it emits from its ears
can reduce a large boulder to pebbles.
It swoops out of the dark to attack."
11593,715,29,"Although it has a violent disposition, if you give
it a nice ripe fruit that it loves, Noivern will
suddenly become tame."
11594,716,23,"Legends say it can share eternal life.
It slept for a thousand years in the form
of a tree before its revival."
11595,716,24,"When the horns on its head shine
in seven colors, it is said to be
sharing everlasting life."
11596,716,25,"Legends say it can share eternal life.

tail feathers spread wide and glow red,
it absorbs the life force of living creatures."

the life energy of every living thing
and turns into a cocoon once more."

tail feathers spread wide and glow red,
it absorbs the life force of living creatures."

the life energy of every living thing
and turns into a cocoon once more."

disarray, it appears and reveals its secret power."

those who destroy the ecosystem
from deep in the cave where it lives."

disarray, it appears and reveals its secret power."
11605,718,26,"It’s hypothesized that it’s monitoring
those who destroy the ecosystem
from deep in the cave where it lives."
11606,718,28,"It’s thought to be monitoring the ecosystem.
There are rumors that even greater power lies
hidden within it."
11607,718,29,"This is Zygarde’s form when about half of its
pieces have been assembled. It plays the role of
monitoring the ecosystem."
11608,719,23,"A sudden transformation of Carbink,
its pink, glimmering body is said to be
the loveliest sight in the whole world."
11609,719,24,"It can instantly create many diamonds
by compressing the carbon in the air
between its hands."
11610,719,25,"A sudden transformation of Carbink,
its pink, glimmering body is said to be
the loveliest sight in the whole world."

11612,720,23,"This troublemaker sends anything
and everything to faraway places
using its loop, which can warp space."
11613,720,24,"It gathers things it likes and passes them through
its loop to teleport them to a secret place."
11614,720,25,"In its true form, it possess a huge amount of power.
Legends of its avarice tell how it once carried off
an entire castle to gain the treasure hidden within."
11615,720,26,"It is said to be able to seize anything it desires
with its six rings and six huge arms. With its power
sealed, it is transformed into a much smaller form."
11616,721,23,"It lets out billows of steam and disappears into
the dense fog. It’s said to live in mountains
where humans do not tread."
11617,721,24,"It expels its internal steam from the
arms on its back. It has enough
power to blow away a mountain."

the dense fog. It’s said to live in mountains
where humans do not tread."
11619,721,26,"It expels its internal steam from the
arms on its back. It has enough
power to blow away a mountain."
11620,722,28,"Silently it glides, drawing near its targets. Before
they even notice it, it begins to pelt them with
vicious kicks."
11621,722,29,"It sends its feathers, which are as sharp as
blades, flying in attack. Its legs are strong,
so its kicks are also formidable."
11622,723,28,"It throws sharp feathers called blade quills
at enemies or prey. It seldom misses."
11623,723,29,"This narcissistic Pokémon is a clean freak.
If you don’t groom it diligently, it will stop
listening to you."
11624,724,28,"Although basically cool and cautious, when it’s
caught by surprise, it’s seized by panic."
11625,724,29,"It nocks its arrow quills and shoots them at
opponents. When it simply can’t afford to miss,
it tugs the vine on its head to improve its focus."
11626,725,28,"It doesn’t allow its emotions to be easily seen.
Earning its trust takes time. It prefers solitude."
11627,725,29,"If you try too hard to get close to it, it won’t
open up to you. Even if you do grow close, giving
it too much affection is still a no-no."
11628,726,28,"It boasts powerful front legs. With a single
punch, it can bend an iron bar right over."
11629,726,29,"It can act spoiled if it grows close to its Trainer.
A powerful Pokémon, its sharp claws can leave
its Trainer’s whole body covered in scratches."
11630,727,28,"After hurling ferocious punches and flinging
furious kicks, it finishes opponents off by
spewing fire from around its navel."
11631,727,29,"Although it’s rough mannered and egotistical, it
finds beating down unworthy opponents boring.
It gets motivated for stronger opponents."
11632,728,28,"This Pokémon can control water bubbles. It
practices diligently so it can learn to make
big bubbles."
11633,728,29,"The balloons it inflates with its nose grow
larger and larger as it practices day by day."
11634,729,28,"It cares deeply for its companions. When its
Trainer is feeling down, it performs a cheery
dance to try and help."
11635,729,29,"It gets excited when it sees a dance it doesn’t
know. This hard worker practices diligently until
it can learn that dance."
11636,730,28,"Its singing voice is its chief weapon in battle.
This Pokémon’s Trainer must prioritize the daily
maintenance of its throat at all costs."
11637,730,29,"To Primarina, every battle is a stage. It takes
down its prey with beautiful singing
and dancing."
11638,731,28,"This Pokémon feeds on berries, whose leftover
seeds become the ammunition for the attacks it
fires off from its mouth."
11639,731,29,"It pecks at trees with its hard beak. You can
get some idea of its mood or condition from the
rhythm of its pecking."
11640,732,28,"By bending its beak, it can produce a variety of
calls and brand itself a noisy nuisance for
its neighbors."
11641,732,29,"It can bend the tip of its beak to produce over
a hundred different cries at will."
11642,733,28,"Within its beak, its internal gas ignites,
explosively launching seeds with enough power
to pulverize boulders."
11643,733,29,"They smack beaks with others of their kind to
communicate. The strength and number of hits
tell each other how they feel."
11644,734,28,"It wanders around in a never-ending search for
food. At dusk, it collapses from exhaustion and
falls asleep on the spot."
11645,734,29,"Its stomach takes up most of its long torso.
It’s a big eater, so the amount Trainers have to
spend on its food is no laughing matter."
11646,735,28,"It adores having Rattata and Raticate for dinner,
but as it’s diurnal, it never encounters them.
This Pokémon boasts incredible patience."
11647,735,29,"Although it wasn’t originally found in Alola, this
Pokémon was brought over a long time ago
when there was a huge Rattata outbreak."
11648,736,28,"They often gather near places frequented by
electric Pokémon in order to avoid being
attacked by bird Pokémon."
11649,736,29,"If you find its nest, you shouldn’t stick your
hand inside. You’ll get bitten by an
irritated Grubbin."
11650,737,28,"From the food it digests, it generates electricity,
and it stores this energy in its electric sac."
11651,737,29,"It buries itself in fallen leaves and barely
moves, munching away on humus. If you
accidentally step on one, you’ll get a shock!"
11652,738,28,"It produces electricity via an electrical organ in
its abdomen. It overwhelms bird Pokémon with
shocking beams of electrical energy."
11653,738,29,"It has an organ that generates electricity in its
abdomen. It concentrates energy in its strong
jaws and fires off powerful jolts of electricity."
11654,739,28,"It punches so much, its pincers often come off
from overuse, but they grow back quickly. What
little meat they contain is rich and delicious."
11655,739,29,"Its hard pincers are well suited to both offense
and defense. Fights between two Crabrawler
are like boxing matches."
11656,740,28,"It just throws punches indiscriminately. In times
of desperation, it can lop off its own pincers
and fire them like rockets."
11657,740,29,"It stores coldness in its pincers and pummels its
foes. It can even smash thick walls of ice
to bits!"
11658,741,28,"This Oricorio has sipped red nectar. Its
passionate dance moves cause its enemies
to combust in both body and mind."
11659,741,29,"It wins the hearts of its enemies with its
passionate dancing and then uses the opening
it creates to burn them up with blazing flames."
11660,742,28,"Myriads of Cutiefly flutter above the heads of
people who have auras resembling those
of flowers."
11661,742,29,"Nectar and pollen are its favorite fare. In fields
of flowers, it gets into skirmishes with
Butterfree over food."
11662,743,28,"Some of Ribombee’s pollen puffs are highly
nutritious. They are sometimes sold
as supplements."
11663,743,29,"Rain makes pollen damp, so Ribombee hates
rain. When it sees ominous clouds, it finds a
hollow in a tree, where it waits stock-still."
11664,744,28,"This Pokémon has lived with people since times
long ago. It can sense when its Trainer is in the
dumps and will stick close by its Trainer’s side."
11665,744,29,"As they develop, their disposition grows more
violent and aggressive. Many Trainers find them
too much to handle and abandon them."
11666,745,28,"When properly raised from a young age, it will
become a trustworthy partner that will
absolutely never betray its Trainer."
11667,745,29,"The sharp rocks in its mane can cut like knives.
Lycanroc wears its prey down by degrees
before finishing them off."
11668,746,28,"It’s awfully weak and notably tasty, so everyone
is always out to get it. As it happens, anyone
trying to bully it receives a painful lesson."
11669,746,29,"They’re weak, so they move in schools.
However, they can also often be seen all alone,
having strayed from the school."
11670,747,28,"It’s found crawling on beaches and seafloors.
The coral that grows on Corsola’s head is as
good as a five-star banquet to this Pokémon."
11671,747,29,"They eat Corsola branches, so Mareanie are
hated by craftsmen who work with Corsola
branches that have naturally fallen off."
11672,748,28,"Those attacked by Toxapex’s poison will suffer
intense pain for three days and three nights.
Post-recovery, there will be some aftereffects."
11673,748,29,"To attack, this Pokémon sends toxic spikes
flying at its enemies. Ones that come close get
mown down by the claws on its feet."
11674,749,28,"It has a stubborn, individualistic disposition.
Eating dirt, making mud, and playing in the mire
all form part of its daily routine."
11675,749,29,"It loves playing in the mud. If it isn’t showered
with mud on a daily basis, it gets stressed
out and stops listening to its Trainer."
11676,750,28,"Its heavy, mud-covered kicks are its best
means of attack, and it can reduce large trucks
to scrap without breaking a sweat."
11677,750,29,"It remains calm and unmoving no matter the
situation. It mixes dirt with the saliva in its
mouth to make a special kind of mud."
11678,751,28,"When it comes across enemies or potential prey,
this Pokémon smashes its
water-bubble-covered head into them."
11679,751,29,"When two Dewpider meet, they display their
water bubbles to each other. Then the one with
the smaller bubble gets out of the other’s way."
11680,752,28,"Despite what its appearance suggests, it cares
for others. If it finds vulnerable, weak Pokémon,
it protectively brings them into its water bubble."
11681,752,29,"It usually passes its time in the water. When its
belly is full, it stores its subdued prey in the
water bubble on its head."
11682,753,28,"They give off a sweet and refreshing scent.
Cutiefly often gather near the tall grass where
Fomantis are hiding."
11683,753,29,"When the sun rises, Fomantis spreads its four
leaves and bathes in the sunlight. The tip of its
head has a pleasant aroma."
11684,754,28,"It fires beams from its sickle-shaped petals.
These beams are powerful enough to cleave
through thick metal plates."
11685,754,29,"For self-protection, it pretends to be a bug
Pokémon. Both of its arms bear
keen-edged petals."
11686,755,28,"As it drowses the day away, it nourishes itself
by sucking from tree roots. It wakens at the fall
of night, wandering off in search of a new tree."
11687,755,29,"It scatters its shining spores around itself.
Even though they’re dangerous, nighttime tours
of forests where Morelull live are popular."
11688,756,28,"It emits flickering spores that cause drowsiness.
When its prey succumb to sleep, this Pokémon
feeds on them by sucking in their energy."
11689,756,29,"It puts its prey to sleep and siphons off their
vitality through the tip of its arms. If one of its
kind is weakened, it helps by sending it vitality."
11690,757,28,"Volcanoes or dry, craggy places are its home.
It emanates a sweet-smelling poisonous gas
that attracts bug Pokémon, then attacks them."
11691,757,29,"The males will do whatever the females tell
them. They give the females most of their food.
Due to malnutrition, the males can’t evolve."
11692,758,28,"Filled with pheromones, its poisonous gas can
be diluted to use in the production of
luscious perfumes."
11693,758,29,"Salazzle lives deep in caves and forces the
Salandit it has attracted with its pheromones
to serve it."
11694,759,28,"A touch from anyone except a known friend
sends it into a surging frenzy. It’s an incredibly
dangerous Pokémon."
11695,759,29,"It boasts power enough to split large trees in
half. The organ on its rear releases an odor that
it uses to communicate with others of its kind."
11696,760,28,"This Pokémon has the habit of hugging its
companions. Many Trainers have left this world
after their spines were squashed by its hug."
11697,760,29,"It waves its hands wildly in intimidation and
warning. Life is over for anyone who doesn’t
run away as fast as possible."
11698,761,28,"Although it’s too sugary for human consumption,
Bounsweet’s sweat can be watered down into a
juice with just the right amount of sweetness."
11699,761,29,"Because of its sweet, delicious aroma, bird
Pokémon are always after it, but it’s not
intelligent enough to care."
11700,762,28,"This Pokémon is always bouncing around
energetically. Other Pokémon are attracted by
its lively appearance and pleasant aroma."
11701,762,29,"It’s protected by its hard sepals, so it plays
with bird Pokémon without worry. They peck it
relentlessly, but it doesn’t care."
11702,763,28,"A Pokémon known for the beauty of its
well-shaped legs, it sometimes appears as a
mascot in advertisements for beauty salons."
11703,763,29,"A master of grand and beautiful kicks, it can
knock out even kickboxing champions with a
single blow."
11704,764,28,"Baths prepared with the flowers from its vine
have a relaxing effect, so this Pokémon
is a hit with many people."
11705,764,29,"It stretches sticky vines out from its head and
picks flowers to adorn itself with. When it
doesn’t have any flowers, it feels uneasy."
11706,765,28,"Deep in the jungle, high in the lofty canopy, this
Pokémon abides. On rare occasions, it shows up
at the beach to match wits with Slowking."
11707,765,29,"It normally spends its time meditating in the
treetops. It throws Poké Balls and gives other
Pokémon orders as it pleases."
11708,766,28,"They battle with hard berries for weapons.
Their techniques are passed from the boss to
the group, generation upon generation."
11709,766,29,"They use their saliva to stick leaves to their
shoulders. You can tell what troop they belong
to from the position of the leaves."
11710,767,28,"Its habitat varies from beaches to seabeds.
A natural scavenger, it will gleefully chow down
on anything edible, no matter how rotten."
11711,767,29,"It will pick up anything it finds on the ground.
Sometimes it finds coins, so Murkrow and
Meowth will go after it."
11712,768,28,"It battles skillfully with its six arms, but spends
most of its time peacefully meditating in caves
deep beneath the sea."
11713,768,29,"The shell covering its body is as hard as
diamond. This Pokémon will do anything it
takes to win."
11714,769,28,"It takes control of anyone who puts a hand in its
mouth. And so it adds to the accumulation of
its sand-mound body."
11715,769,29,"It likes the shovel on its head, so Sandygast
will get serious and fight any children who come
to take it back."
11716,770,28,"Buried beneath the castle are masses of
dried-up bones from those whose vitality
it has drained."
11717,770,29,"Each of its grains of sand has its own will.
Palossand eats small Pokémon and siphons
away their vital essence while they’re still alive."
11718,771,28,"These Pokémon line the beaches. The sticky
mucous that covers their bodies can be used to
soothe sunburned skin. How convenient!"
11719,771,29,"The tradition known as Pyukumuku chucking
started from the custom of throwing Pyukumuku
back into the sea after they wash onshore."
11720,772,28,"Due to the danger that this synthetic Pokémon
may go on a rampage, it wears a control mask
to restrain its power."
11721,772,29,"A Pokémon weapon developed for a specific
mission, it went berserk during an experiment,
so it was cryogenically frozen."
11722,773,28,"Although its name was Type: Null at first, the
boy who evolved it into this form gave it the
name by which it is now known."
11723,773,29,"This is its form once it has awakened and
evolved. Freed from its heavy mask, its speed is
greatly increased."
11724,774,28,"Strong impacts can knock it out of its shell. This
Pokémon was born from mutated nanoparticles."
11725,774,29,"It lives in the ozone layer, where it becomes
food for stronger Pokémon. When it tries to run
away, it falls to the ground."
11726,775,28,"The log it holds was given to it by its parents at
birth. It has also been known to cling to the arm
of a friendly Trainer."
11727,775,29,"It stays asleep from the moment it’s born.
When it falls into a deep sleep, it stops
moving altogether."
11728,776,28,"It gushes fire and poisonous gases from its
nostrils. Its dung is an explosive substance and
can be put to various uses."
11729,776,29,"It lives in volcanoes and eats sulfur and other
minerals. Materials from the food it eats form
the basis of its explosive shell."
11730,777,28,"The long hairs on its back act as lightning rods.
The bolts of lightning it attracts are stored as
energy in its electric sac."
11731,777,29,"When it’s surprised or agitated, the 14 fur
spikes on its back will stand up involuntarily."
11732,778,28,"A lonely Pokémon, it conceals its terrifying
appearance beneath an old rag so it can get
closer to people and other Pokémon."
11733,778,29,"Although it’s a quiet, lonely Pokémon, if you try
to look at what’s under its rag, it will become
agitated and resist violently."
11734,779,28,"It stuns its prey with psychokinesis and then
grinds them to mush with its strong teeth.
Even Shellder’s shell is no match for it."
11735,779,29,"It burrows beneath the sand, radiating
psychic power from the protuberance on its
head. It waits for prey as it surveys the area."
11736,780,28,"This Pokémon is friendly to people and loves
children most of all. It comes from deep in the
mountains to play with children it likes in town."
11737,780,29,"If a child it has made friends with is bullied,
Drampa will find the bully’s house and burn it to
the ground."
11738,781,28,"The soul of seaweed adrift in the waves became
reborn as this Pokémon. It maintains itself with
new infusions of seabed detritus and seaweed."
11739,781,29,"It wraps its prey in green seaweed and sucks
away their vitality. It only likes to go after big
prey like Wailord."
11740,782,28,"They live in mountains where no trace of
humans can be detected. Jangmo-o grow
little by little as they battle one another."
11741,782,29,"It smacks the scales on its head against rocks
or against the ground to frighten its opponents.
It can also contact its friends with these noises."
11742,783,28,"It sheds and regrows its scales on a continuous
basis. The scales become harder and sharper
each time they’re regrown."
11743,783,29,"It makes noise by clanging its scales together.
When the rhythm has reached its peak,
Hakamo-o attacks."
11744,784,28,"Its rigid scales function as offense and defense.
In the past, its scales were processed and used
to make weapons and other commodities."
11745,784,29,"When it howls after finishing off its prey, the
metallic sounds of its celebrating comrades can
be heard from all around."
11746,785,28,"It confuses its enemies by flying too quickly for
the eye to follow. It has a hair-trigger temper
but forgets what made it angry an instant later."
11747,785,29,"Although it’s called a guardian deity, if a person
or Pokémon puts it in a bad mood, it will become
a malevolent deity and attack."
11748,786,28,"As it flutters about, it scatters its strangely
glowing scales. Touching them is said to restore
good health on the spot."
11749,786,29,"It heals the wounds of people and Pokémon by
sprinkling them with its sparkling scales. This
guardian deity is worshiped on Akala."
11750,787,28,"The guardian deity of Ula’ula is a lazy Pokémon.
It commands plants to immobilize its foes and
then deals them a savage blow with its horns."
11751,787,29,"Although it’s called a guardian deity, it’s violent
enough to crush anyone it sees as an enemy."
11752,788,28,"The guardian deity of Poni, it can control water.
People say it can create pure water that will
wash away any uncleanness."
11753,788,29,"This guardian deity of Poni Island manipulates
water. Because it lives deep within a thick fog,
it came to be both feared and revered."
11754,789,28,"In ages past, it was called the child of the stars.
It’s said to be a Pokémon from another world,
but no specific details are known."
11755,789,29,"Even though its helpless, gaseous body can be
blown away by the slightest breeze, it doesn’t
seem to care."
11756,790,28,"There’s something accumulating around the
black core within its hard shell. People think
this Pokémon may come from another world."
11757,790,29,"The king who ruled Alola in times of antiquity
called it the “cocoon of the stars” and built
an altar to worship it."
11758,791,28,"This Pokémon is said to be a male evolution of
Cosmog. At the activation of its third eye, it
departs for another world."
11759,791,29,"Sometimes the result of its opening an Ultra
Wormhole is that energy and life-forms from
other worlds are called here to this world."
11760,792,28,"Said to live in another world, this Pokémon
devours light, drawing the moonless dark veil of
night over the brightness of day."
11761,792,29,"Records of it exist in writings from long, long
ago, where it was known by the name
“the beast that calls the moon.”"
11762,793,28,"One of the Ultra Beasts. It’s unclear whether or
not this Pokémon is sentient, but sometimes it
can be observed behaving like a young girl."
11763,793,29,"A life-form from another world, it was dubbed
a UB and is thought to produce a
strong neurotoxin."
11764,794,28,"A mysterious life-form called an Ultra Beast.
Witnesses saw it pulverize a dump truck with a
single punch."
11765,794,29,"Although it’s alien to this world and a danger
here, it’s apparently a common organism in the
world where it normally lives."
11766,795,28,"One of the Ultra Beasts. It refuses to touch
anything, perhaps because it senses some
uncleanness in this world."
11767,795,29,"A life-form that lives in another world, its body
is thin and supple, but it also possesses
great power."
11768,796,28,"It appeared from the Ultra Wormhole. It raided a
power plant, so people think it energizes itself
with electricity."
11769,796,29,"Although it’s alien to this world and a danger
here, it’s apparently a common organism in the
world where it normally lives."
11770,797,28,"One kind of Ultra Beast. Witnesses have seen it
burn down a forest by expelling gas from its
two arms."
11771,797,29,"One of the dangerous UBs, high energy readings
can be detected coming from both of its
huge arms."
11772,798,28,"One of the Ultra Beast life-forms, it was
observed cutting down a gigantic steel tower
with one stroke of its blade."
11773,798,29,"This Ultra Beast’s body, which is as thin as
paper, is like a sharpened sword."
11774,799,28,"A dangerous Ultra Beast, it appears to be eating
constantly, but for some reason its droppings
have never been found."
11775,799,29,"Although it’s alien to this world and a danger
here, it’s apparently a common organism in the
world where it normally lives."
11776,800,28,"Light is apparently the source of its energy.
It has an extraordinarily vicious disposition
and is constantly firing off laser beams."
11777,800,29,"It looks somehow pained as it rages around in
search of light, which serves as its energy.
It’s apparently from another world."
11778,801,28,"Its mechanized body is merely a vessel. Its true
self is its Soul-Heart, an artificial soul."
11779,801,29,"It synchronizes its consciousness with others
to understand their feelings. This faculty makes
it useful for taking care of people."
11780,802,28,"It lurks in the shadows of others, copying their
movements and powers. This Pokémon is craven
and cowering."
11781,802,29,"It slips into the shadows of others and mimics
their powers and movements. As it improves, it
becomes stronger than those it’s imitating."
11782,803,29,"This Ultra Beast is well enough liked to be
chosen as a first partner in its own world."
11783,804,29,"It stores hundreds of liters of poisonous liquid
inside its body. It is one of the organisms known
as UBs."
11784,805,29,"It appeared from an Ultra Wormhole. Each one
appears to be made up of many life-forms
stacked one on top of each other."
11785,806,29,"It slithers toward people. Then, without warning,
it triggers the explosion of its own head.
It’s apparently one kind of Ultra Beast."
11786,807,29,"It electrifies its claws and tears its opponents
apart with them. Even if they dodge its attack,
they’ll be electrocuted by the flying sparks."
